# Vision-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning for UAV Autonomous Navigation with Privileged Information

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper: **“Vision-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Autonomous Navigation Using Privileged Information”**, Drones, 2024 – [link to the article](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-446X/8/12/782).

Repository derived from and extending [UAV_Navigation_DRL_AirSim](https://github.com/heleidsn/UAV_Navigation_DRL_AirSim). We thank the original authors for releasing their code.

## Overview

The project introduces a Distributed Privileged Reinforcement Learning (DPRL) framework that improves robustness under partial observability by giving the critic access to privileged information while the actor learns from noisy visual input.  

Our proposed DPRL framework is as followed:

A video demonstrating the autonomous navigation is shown below.

Key elements:

* OpenAI-Gym style environment built on Microsoft AirSim  
* Support for navigation and hovering tasks  
* Single-agent and multi-agent (parallel data collection) training  
* Optional privileged learning schemes

| **Privileged learning**     | No Privileged Learning (no) – actor and critic use noisy images only<br>Privileged-Only Learning (noise_symmetry) – critic uses privileged state only, actor uses noisy images<br>Hybrid Privileged Learning (noise_asymmetry) – critic uses both noisy and privileged inputs, actor uses noisy images |
| **Training mode**           | Single environment · Multi-agent experience collection (launch several UE4 instances, each with a unique `port`)   |
| **Task type**               | Navigation (Nav) · Hovering (Hover)                                                                                               |

The base Unreal environment is provided through a [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MinMEPaCFjhOizRxF32gv4pAq0Z_tRvz/view?usp=drive_link); at runtime the code procedurally spawns obstacles.
